                Chopra has received numerous accolades, including a National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government 
                of India honoured her with the Padma Shri and Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and in the

                which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in The Hero: Love Story of a Spy (2003). She played 
                the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and received critical acclaim for her 
                breakout role in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish
                 and Don (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.<br><br></h4></div>
        
         <div class="ab"><p><h4></h4>Chopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, the gender pay gap, and
                  feminism. She has worked with UNICEF since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights 
                  in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian
                   children. As a recording artist, Chopra has released three singles and provided vocals for a number of her film songs. She is also the
                    founder of the production company Purple Pebble Pictures, under which she has produced several regional Indians films, including the 
                    acclaimed Marathi film Ventilator (2016). Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra's off-screen life, including her marriage to American
                     singer and actor Nick Jonas, is the subject of substantial media coverage.</h4></div>

            Chopra's first film of 2012 was Karan Malhotra's action drama Agneepath, in which she starred with Hrithik Roshan, Sanjay Dutt 
            and Rishi Kapoor. Produced by Karan Johar, the film is a remake of his father's 1990 production of the same name. In one of 
            several accidents to happen during production, Chopra's lehenga (a traditional skirt) caught fire while filming a sequence for
             an elaborate Ganpati festival song.[104] She featured as Kaali Gawde, Roshan's loquacious love interest in the film. Mayank 
             Shekhar noted how much Chopra stood out in the male-dominated film.[105] Agneepath broke Bollywood's highest opening-day 
             earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of ₹1.93 billion (US$27 million).[102][106] Chopra next co-starred with Shahid
              Kapoor in Kunal Kohli's romance, Teri Meri Kahaani. The film relates the stories of three unconnected couples (each played by
               Kapoor and Chopra), born in different eras.[107].Anurag Basu's Barfi!, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was her final 
               appearance of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film tells the story of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra 
               played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who falls in love with a deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Rituparno Ghosh, an acclaimed
                director, considered it a "very, very brave" role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a
                 woman with autism.[108] To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic
                  people.[109] The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, earning ₹1.75 billion 
                  (US$25 million) worldwide.[111] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare found Chopra to be the film's "surprise package" and found her 
                  performance to be "the best representation of [autism] on Indian celluloid".[112] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph noted 
                  that Kapoor and Chopra turn in two of the finest performances seen on the Indian screen, although he found her to be 
                  a "tad showy" in her part.[113] Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild
                   Film Awards.[99] The film was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards.[114] Don 2, Agneepath and Barfi! 
                   ranked among the highest grossing Bollywood films to that point.[102]
